## About Changeable

`Changable` is a wrapper on an object regardless if it will be `class` or `struct` that can be changed using one exposed method `set`. What makes it different that normal set is that all of the changes made using `set` method won't be immediately applied but after using `commit` method. To fully cover needs `Changeable` also allows you to reset pending changes by `reset` method.

In addition `Changeable` gives you possibility to check current pending changes and last made changes. Also `Changeable` can be observed with changes that occurs during it's lifetime.

This gives the opportunity to react on specific state changes that you are interested in.

Example:

```swift
class SomeState {
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    var counter: Int = 0
}

let value = Changeable<SomeState>(value: SomeState())

value.add(observer: { (change) in
    if change.changedKeyPaths == [\SomeState.isLoading] {
        print("‚è≥ Loading has changed")
    }
    
    if change ~= [\SomeState.counter] {
    	print("üíØ Counter has changed")
    }
    
    if let counter = change.changeMatching(\SomeState.counter) {
        print("üíØ Counter: \(counter)") // Output: 1
    }
})

value.set(for: \SomeState.isLoading, value: false)
value.set(for: \SomeState.counter, value: 1)
value.commit()

value.set(for: \SomeState.counter, value: 2)
value.reset()

if let lastCounterValue = value.lastChangeMatching(\SomeState.counter) {
    print("last changed counter value: \(lastCounterValue)") // Output: 1
}

if value.lastChanges.contains(\SomeState.isLoading) {
    print("The last changes contains loading change")
}
```

More examples you will find in the playgound and in tests.
